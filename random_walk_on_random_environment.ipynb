    "Let $\\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers, we are going to define a **Simple Exclusion Process** $X_t$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ in order  to define a random environment and above that another particle will do **Random walk** over this random environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In time $t=0$ for each $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is drawn independently from a Bernoulli $\\frac{1}{2}$ distribution to define if there is a particle in position $i$ or if there is no particle in that place. When times passes from $t=0$ to $t=1$, the environment changes with the following rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $s$ is drawn from a *Poisson* distribution of mean $v$ (v means the velocity of the environment).\n",
    "- $s$ particles are chosen (with replacement) to move. The order that we choose the particles to move matters.\n",
    "- For each particle *to move*, if the position of the particle is $i$ then the new position of that particle is $i-1$ or $i+1$ with the same probability, but the particle only moves to that new position if there is no other particle occupying the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the interchanges of the environment a (discrete) **Random walk** is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The random walk starts at position $0$, that is $X_0=0$.\n",
    "- If the random walk is in a position where there is a particle, then the random walk has a *right drift*, which means the probability of the random walk to go to the right neighbor is $2/3$ and the probability to go to the left neighbor is $1/3$.\n",
    "- Otherwise the random walk is in a position without particle and there is a *left drift*, which means the probability to go to left is $2/3$ and the probability to go to the right is $1/3$.\n",
